# Moscow_SUHI
Code used to get and analyse Moscow SUHI (Surface Urban Heat Island) in 1984-2024 using Landsat-5,8 data.
<br>
It's free to use for your own researches on SUHI anywhere on Earth.

# This data includes:
1. Google Earth Engine (js) code for raw data processing and receiving data for further analysis
2. Jupyter notebooks used for data analysis, including:
   - clustering_area_dynamics: general SUHI area dynamics analysis
   - lcz_time_series_analysis: average LST (land surface temperature) dynamics analysis by dedicated local climate zones
   - suhi_area_dynamics: SUHI area dynamics analysis by cluster (intensity type)
   - CRU_TS_vs_LST_validation: CRU TS Reanalysis-based received data validation
<br>
This research was completed as part of a 3rd year coursework project in HSE, 2024-2025.

Note that since I'm not really good at using JS, neural networks (ChatGPT, Grok) were actually used to get some parts of the JS code in Google Earth Engine.
